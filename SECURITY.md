# Security Documentation for DormitoriesPlus

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the DormitoriesPlus system to ensure the protection of sensitive data and secure access control.

## 1. Data Encryption

### At Rest
- All sensitive data is stored in a PostgreSQL database with encryption at rest
- Passwords are hashed using Django's secure password hashing system
- Database credentials are stored in environment variables, not in code
- Media files are stored securely with proper access controls

### In Transit
- All communications are encrypted using HTTPS
- CSRF protection is enabled for all forms
- Secure session handling with encrypted cookies
- API endpoints are protected with authentication

## 2. Authentication System

### User Authentication
- Django's built-in authentication system is used
- Secure password validation with the following requirements:
  - Minimum length validation
  - Common password validation
  - Numeric password validation
  - User attribute similarity validation
- Session-based authentication with secure session handling
- Automatic session timeout
- Protection against brute force attacks

### Password Management
- Passwords are hashed using Django's secure hashing algorithms
- Password reset functionality with secure token generation
- Password change requires current password verification
- Default passwords are required to be changed on first login

## 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### User Roles
The system implements three distinct roles with specific permissions:

1. **Student**
   - Access to personal information
   - Submit equipment rental requests
   - Report faults
   - View personal room assignments
   - Access to student-specific features

2. **Building Staff**
   - Manage assigned buildings
   - Handle equipment requests for their buildings
   - Process fault reports for their buildings
   - Manage student assignments in their buildings
   - Access building-specific reports

3. **Office Staff**
   - Full system access
   - Manage all buildings
   - Handle all equipment requests
   - Process all fault reports
   - Manage all student assignments
   - Access system-wide reports
   - Manage building staff assignments

### Access Control Implementation
- Role-based view access using `@login_required` decorator
- Role-specific redirects after login
- Building-specific access restrictions for building staff
- Hierarchical permission system
- Automatic access control based on user role

## 4. Security Best Practices

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Protection against SQL injection using Django ORM
- XSS protection through Django's template system
- CSRF protection for all forms
- File upload validation and sanitization

### Session Security
- Secure session configuration
- Session timeout implementation
- Protection against session hijacking
- Secure cookie settings

### API Security
- Authentication required for all API endpoints
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- Input validation for all API requests
- Secure error handling

## 5. Security Headers

The system implements the following security headers:
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Content-Security-Policy
- Strict-Transport-Security

## 6. Monitoring and Logging

- Authentication attempts logging
- Failed login attempts tracking
- Security-relevant actions logging
- Error logging with sensitive data filtering
- Regular security audit logging

## 7. Development Security

### Code Security
- Regular security updates
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code security reviews
- Secure coding practices

### Environment Security
- Development/Production environment separation
- Secure configuration management
- Environment variable protection
- Database access control

## 8. Incident Response

In case of security incidents:
1. Immediate system isolation if necessary
2. Investigation of the incident
3. Implementation of security patches
4. User notification if required
5. Documentation of the incident and response

## 9. Regular Security Maintenance

- Regular security updates
- Dependency updates
- Security patch management
- Regular security audits
- Backup and recovery testing

## Contact

For security concerns or to report vulnerabilities, please contact the system administrators.
