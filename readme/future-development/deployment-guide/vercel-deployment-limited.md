# Vercel Deployment (Limited)

### Current Vercel Setup

Your current `vercel.json` is configured for serverless deployment, not Docker.

**Limitations with Vercel:**

* ❌ No persistent database connections
* ❌ Limited to serverless functions
* ❌ No background tasks
* ❌ File upload limitations
* ❌ Session storage issues

### Alternative: Vercel + External Database

If you want to use Vercel, you'll need to:

1. Use external database (PlanetScale, Supabase)
2. Convert to serverless functions
3. Use external file storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary)
